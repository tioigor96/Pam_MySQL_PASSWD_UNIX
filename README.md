# Pam_MySQL_PASSWD_UNIX

Here u can fuond an example of a passwd for pam_mysql.so.

I suppose you save users in a table called "users".

This implementation resolve my particular case, but i would trust
it can help you.

We can have a better implementation if you implement mysql statement.

Anybody can help to improve my sourcecode.

thx 4 all.
